	‚Ä¢	Research popular AI applications and real-world problems
	‚Ä¢	Brainstorm potential AI web app ideas
	‚Ä¢	Select a viable AI web app idea with real-world use cases and daily usage potential
	‚Ä¢	Define core features and target audience

Phase 2: Design application architecture and user interface
	‚Ä¢	Design the overall architecture of the web application
	‚Ä¢	Create wireframes or mockups for the user interface
	‚Ä¢	Define the technology stack

Phase 3: Implement backend API with AI integration
	‚Ä¢	Set up the backend development environment
	‚Ä¢	Implement the core AI model or integrate with an existing AI service

	‚Ä¢	Integrate frontend with backend API

Phase 5: Test application functionality locally
	‚Ä¢	Conduct unit tests for backend and frontend components
	‚Ä¢	Perform integration testing
	‚Ä¢	Debug and fix any issues

Phase 6: Deploy application to production
	‚Ä¢	Prepare the application for deployment
	‚Ä¢	Deploy the backend API
	‚Ä¢	Deploy the frontend application

Phase 7: Create documentation and deliver final application
	‚Ä¢	Write user documentation
	‚Ä¢	Write developer documentation
	‚Ä¢	Present the final application and documentation to the user


Build and deploy the project on here --- do all that is necessary(edit/create/remove/modify and more) in order to make the project working and with live and working API clients and with no mockups, no auth, no fallbacks, and no simulations and all working code. Do everything necessary to deliver a fully working repository and clear, runnable instructions so a competent developer can clone, run, test, and deploy it instantly. You may choose the tech stack ‚Äî pick what you believe is best for reliability, developer experience, performance, accessibility, and security ‚Äî but explain and justify your choices up front. Take full creative and technical liberty. Produce the best possible implementation, with no shortcuts, no limitations, and no placeholders. Every piece of code must be fully implemented, functional, and runnable ‚Äî no TODOs, no stubs, no ‚Äúexample only‚Äù comments. Deliver a repository that feels like it came from a top-tier engineering team.
